## Peanut Butter & Jelly Lab

This lab is a little different than your typical one, and will be our last fully non-technical for a while. Do this lab before  

### Objective: 
* Break a problem down into its constitutent parts, identify reasoning loops, tools, skills, and constraints.
* Compare human reasoning to LLM reasoning.

## Deliverable
Your flow chart and explanation. Of the decision points and loops.

## Steps
1. Pick something banal that you know how to do really well (i.e., make a PB&J, prepare your bag for the day, pick out an outfit, etc.)
2. Clearly define the goal. What does "complete" mean - be VERY specific
3. Start the loop
