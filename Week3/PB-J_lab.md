## Peanut Butter & Jelly Lab

This lab is a little different than your typical one, and will be our last fully non-technical for a while. Do this lab before  

### Objective: 
* Break a problem down into its constitutent parts, identify reasoning loops, tools, skills, and constraints.
* Compare human reasoning to LLM reasoning.

## Deliverable
Your flow chart and explanation. Of the decision points and loops.

## Steps
**Do NOT use an LLM for this**
1. Pick something banal that you know how to do really well (i.e., make a PB&J, prepare your bag for the day, pick out an outfit, etc.)
2. Clearly define the goal. What does "complete" mean - be VERY specific
3. Write down all of the steps you can think of. For each step, specify a goal.
4. Write down all the tools you think the model would need
5. Start the ReAct cycle loop with a thought (remember [the loop from discussion](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jzlJwTO4alRlTPQinUsJr4FMqK1RX1woJlOD1p63WRY/edit?slide=id.g392b7cf3e29_0_15#slide=id.g392b7cf3e29_0_15)), and articulate the thought, action, observation of each step.
6. Be sure to include at least one failure (i.e., all the knives are dirty)
7. Indicate where in the ReAct loop, the model calls a tool.

**Use your favorite LLM for this**
1. Give a reasoning model the instruction to do your task (i.e., "make a PB&J") and explicitly tell it to reason step-by-step and show its reasoning.
2. Tell it to also indicate where it needs access to tools. 
3. Did the LLM have more, fewer or the same steps as you?
4. What are the tradeoffs of this type of "reasoning" compared to human type?

The first part can be handwritten, from a computer program, whatever. The second part should be a simple write up.
