Next steps
Michelle: Record and upload a video walkthrough of the first lab before the weekend (or as soon as possible).
All students: Complete the "single tool agent" lab (Databricks or LangChain option) before the next class.
All students: Read "Building Effective Agents" by Anthropic before the next class.
Michelle: Set up an agent to create a class glossary/wiki from the transcript.
All students: If using the LangChain/GUI/Anthropic option for labs, record a short video demonstrating the lab and send it to Michelle.
All students: If encountering issues with a lab after 3 hours of effort, write up what was done and what isn't working, and submit to Michelle.
All students: Submit project proposals including problem statement and proposed design according to the project schedule.
Michelle: Send out a lab (as mentioned: "I will send out a lab if anybody wants to play with this")—assumed to be related to LLM temperature demonstration.
All students: Review the syllabus and readings, especially those marked with an asterisk, and skim optional readings as time allows.
All students: Participate in the class choice vote (for anthropomorphism week focus) next week.
Michelle: Update next week's lecture to include detailed explanation of how vectors are made in LLMs.
Michelle: Provide feedback to students who submit explanations of lab issues.
All students: Contact Michelle if they have not received an email from her.
All students: Use Michelle's Gmail for correspondence.
Summary
AI Tools in the Workplace

Michelle greeted the class and discussed the unique moment in workplace history, emphasizing the shift towards AI and tools like Databricks and LangChain. She encouraged students to explore the no-code experience of LangChain, offering support for those who prefer coding on Databricks. Michelle also mentioned her experience with Copilot and the importance of adapting to new technologies. She invited remote students to check in and confirmed that they could hear the class well.

Introduction to AGentic AI Course

Michelle introduced the course on AGentic AI, emphasizing the historical context of agents since the 1950s and the recent advancements in technology that have made agents more accessible and useful. She explained the concept of agents as decision-making tools powered by LLMs and APIs, highlighting the shift from accuracy to usefulness in recent years. Michelle shared her background in linguistics and her experience working with LLMs, and introduced the course's focus on building an agentic workflow to solve problems, catering to both beginners and experienced programmers.

AI Agents Course Introduction

The meeting was an introductory session for a course on AI agents, where Michelle, the instructor, provided an overview of her background and teaching philosophy. Students introduced themselves and shared their reasons for taking the course, highlighting their interest in understanding AI agents, ethical considerations, and potential applications in various fields. Key themes included the importance of critical evaluation of AI systems, the need for ethical considerations in AI development, and the potential for AI to shape culture and decision-making. Students also discussed historical failures related to technology and ethics, emphasizing the importance of learning from past mistakes to guide future AI development.

AI's Role in Contracting Evolution

The group discussed the role of agents and contractors in work processes, with Michelle sharing her experience of using agents to convert content for partners like Microsoft and SAP, noting that she now trusts agents more than contractors due to their reliability and predictability. Hyojin raised questions about bias and skepticism in AI, prompting Michelle to emphasize the value of a fine arts background in fostering critical thinking. The conversation touched on the evolution of contractor work and the increasing reliance on AI, with Michelle suggesting that tasks previously delegated to contractors are now being handled by AI, highlighting a shift in labor dynamics.

Temperature in Large Language Models

Michelle explained the concept of temperature in large language models (LLMs), contrasting deterministic systems with the non-deterministic nature of LLMs. She used Eliza, an early chatbot, as an example of a deterministic system, highlighting its limitations compared to the flexibility of LLMs. Michelle described how temperature affects the output of LLMs, explaining that higher temperatures lead to more diverse and less predictable responses, while lower temperatures result in more focused and repetitive outputs. She emphasized that while LLMs are non-deterministic, they still operate within a finite space of possibilities, which some might argue makes them relatively more deterministic than humans.

Understanding Language Model Operations

Michelle discussed the nature of language models, explaining how they operate on numerical representations of words called vectors and perform vector math to generate responses. She emphasized that LLMs lack a model of the world and do not evaluate reality, which can lead to hallucinations. Michelle also mentioned that she would cover how vectors are created in next week's lecture, as it's crucial for understanding how LLMs work.

Course Structure and Project Guidelines

Michelle discussed the course structure, emphasizing the technical and social halves, and outlined the project requirements, including proposals, technical artifacts, and reflections. She explained the use of LLMs in projects, encouraging students to use them for organization and idea generation while emphasizing the importance of critical thinking. Labs will be completed weekly, with a focus on understanding problem decomposition and agent design. Students were advised to read "Building Effective Agents" before the next class and to complete the first lab before the next meeting.
