# Databricks Option
The lab provided was written by Matthew McCoy for Databricks. Any errata is my own. Please do not distribute this yet as it is not finalized. 
There are some pieces missing from this lab as of 1/27/26 (mostly navigating Databricks, but also explanations about what is happening). Please do not hesitate to reach out if you encounter any issues. 
1. Add me as a user to your workspace (michelleamcsweeney@gmail.com)
2. Create your lab in a Shared workspace.
3. [Download this zip file](https://github.com/michellejm/Agentic_AI_Spring26/blob/main/Week1/Lab1.zip) to your computer.
4. Upload all of the files to the same folder location in Databricks 
5. Follow the lab instructions
6. Email me a link to your Notebook in the shared folder
   

# Langchain Option
Langchain offers templates in their [agent builder product](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/agent-builder). Though I hope you take away from this lab an understanding of how agents are orchestrated, any WYSIWYG interface will do. 
1. [Follow these instructions](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/agent-builder-quickstart) and pick whichever agent sounds most interesting to you. 
2. Record a video of your agent working and explain as much as you understand about which calls are being made and how the orchestration is happening. Be sure to address the ReAct cycle and what steps depend on reasoning. It should be ~5-8 minutes (this is a guess)
